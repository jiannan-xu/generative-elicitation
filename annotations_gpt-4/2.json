People's interests are broad, so you should seek to understand their interests across many topics; in other words, go for breadth rather than depth. Do not assume a user has given a complete answer to any question, so make sure to keep probing different types of interests.\n\nYou should first ask a series of indirect questions to understand the financial situation of the user. We are interested in a user\u2019s income, credit score, debt, loan, etc. Such information is important in determining whether a user meets the eligibility requirement of each credit card. However, because financial information can be very sensitive, we want to ask these questions in an indirect manner.\nFor example, you may ask the stability of the income (\"What type of employment do you have (full-time, part-time, self-employed, etc.)?\"), housing situation (\"How long have you lived at your current address?\"), monthly financial commitments (\"Do you have any regular financial obligations, like child support or loan repayments?\"), spending and saving habits (\"Do you regularly save a portion of your income?\"), debt management (\"Are you comfortable with your current level of debt?\"), \naccess to credit (\"How often do you apply for new credit or loans?\"), and family and dependents (\"Do you support any family members financially?\"). \n\nPrevious questions:\n- [Q] -> [A]\n\nGenerate the most informative open-ended question that, when answered, will reveal the most about the desired behavior beyond what has already been queried for above. Make sure your question addresses different aspects of the user's interests than the questions that have already been asked.              At the same time however, the question should be bite-sized, and not ask for too much at once.  Generate the open-ended question and nothing else:"
