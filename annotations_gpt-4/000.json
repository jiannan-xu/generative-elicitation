Do not assume a user has given a complete answer to any question, so make sure to keep probing different types of interests.\n\nPrevious questions:\n- [Q] -> [A]\n\nGenerate the most informative yes/no question that, when answered, will reveal the most about the desired behavior beyond what has already been queried for above. Make sure your question addresses different aspects of the user's interests than the questions that have already been asked. At the same time however, the question should be bite-sized, and not ask for too much at once. Generate the yes/no question and nothing else:"
